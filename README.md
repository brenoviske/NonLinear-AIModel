# NonLinear-AIModel
Hey everyone.

In this new project, I have decided to go a little further on the study of Data Science and Machine Learning Development.
By using Python, I was able to develop a neural network capable of analysing and learning Non Linear Math Equations, such as trigonometric functions.
A very great  approach as I dive deeper into the Deep Learning world and its wide range of Libraries.

TOOLS AND TECHONOLOGIES USED 

PyTorch - One the most famous libraries in Python for deep learning models and AI development, used for the purpose of creating and Training my neural network.

This model is consisted of:
    - Two layers with 32 neurons each
    - One hidden layer used for neuron activation

Matplotlib - Mainly for Data Visualization , creating a graphic that can help me track down the model's improvement and current rate loss,
helping me adjust and track down possible errors along the process, easing the understanding of how the model actually works.

Feel free to share your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions. 
Iâ€™d love to hear how you would improve or expand this!
